Join us at Burbank's favorite retro video emporium Be Kind Video for a cinematic figure drawing event inspired by Baz Lurhmann's oppulent 1996 adaptation of Shakespeare's tragic romance, "Romeo + Juliet". Featuring a live costumed figure model and a custom curated playlist to transport you to Verona Beach, where we lay our scene.

No drawing experience required! Professional illustrator Sketkh Williams guides artists through a series of timed poses in an inspiring, creative workout for artists of all skill levels. All you need is a pencil and paper, bring your own or use ours!

Thurs 1/18 8PM.

Doors Open at 7:45 pm.

Snacks and beverages available for purchase.

Recommended ages 18+
