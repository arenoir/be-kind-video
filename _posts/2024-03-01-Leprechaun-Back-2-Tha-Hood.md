Sunday March 17th at 7PM we will be Screening Leprechaun Back 2 Tha Hood, with special guest Director Steven Ayromlooi! Q&A following the film.

When Emily Woodrow and her friends happen on a treasure chest full of gold coins, they fail to heed the warnings of a wise old psychic, who had foretold that they would encounter trouble with a very nasty and protective Leprechaun.

This is a very special Screening on St. Patrick's Day!
Get ready to party, Leprechaun Style!
BYOB.

Doors at 6:45PM

Film at 7:00PM.

Q&A to follow.
