Sunday May 19th at 7PM we will be Screening Angus, with Director and Star ZOOM Q&A.


Shy, obese teen Angus Bethune (Charlie Talbert) lives with his 18-wheeler-driving mom (Kathy Bates) and oddball grandfather (George C. Scott). Having loved popular girl Melissa (Ariana Richards) for nearly as long as he's been getting tormented by her jock boyfriend, Rick (James Van Der Beek), he hatches a plan to win her heart. With the help of his cocky nerd pal, Troy (Chris Owen), and a supportive teacher (Rita Moreno), Angus makes a bid to turn the tables on his rival.

Doors at 6:45PM

Q&A 7:00PM.
